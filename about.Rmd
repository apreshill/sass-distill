## Man

### of the

#### hour

That's what he said
But I can't choose between a vegan
And a pot head
So I chose you
Because you're sweet
And you give me lots of lovin'
And you eat meat
And that's how you became
My only man of the hour
You never lie
And you don't cheat
And you don't have any baggage tied
To your four feet
Do I deserve
To be the one
Who will feed you breakfast, lunch, and dinner
And take you to the park at dawn
Will you really be
My only man of the hour
